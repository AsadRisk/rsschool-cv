## Personal info

**Past**

I was born and raised in Uzbekistan. Got my secondary education in the sphere of sport (got a diploma of a swimming trainer), yet my higher education (BA and two MA degrees) was associated with teaching English.

**Present**

I work as English language teacher in a state university of Oman. I like the salary, yet, I seek for something else, where I don`t have to speak to as many people as now.

**Plans for future**

Currently I try to study IT in order to change my career path. Hopefully, I will complete my transfer within 3-4 years.
